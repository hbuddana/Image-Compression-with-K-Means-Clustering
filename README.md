Applied the k-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm using scikit-learn and Python to build an image compression application with interactive controls.</br>

Applied a computationally time-efficient implementation of the k-means algorithm, Mini-Batch K-Means, to compress images, and leverage the Jupyter widgets library to build interactive GUI components to select images from a drop-down list and pick values of k using a slider.
